The practical assignments (server-side and client-side) aim towards building a mobile and distributed, personalised diary application for keeping track of movies you watched and their details. The mobile app will be a movie memoir that allows people to create, delete, add or view a collection of memories that you had about the movies.
The mobile app will interact with the RESTful web service that you create in Assignment 1[MovieMemory], and retrieve some useful and related information from public web APIs.
